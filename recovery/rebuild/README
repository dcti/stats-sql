How to rebuild a project from the base tables:

1. Ensure that the WorkSummary_$PROJECT_ID table doesn't exist. Drop it if it does.

2. Build the WorkSummary table:

sqsh -D stats -U sa -P password -i worksummary.sql $PROJECT_ID

This takes about an hour for RC5 with no web traffic.

3. Build the email stuff:

./rebuild_email.sh $PROJECT_ID '-D stats -U sa -P password'

4. Build the team stuff:

./rebuild_team.sh $PROJECT_ID '-D stats -U sa -P password'

5. Run audit.sql to verify that everything checks out:

The easiest way to do this is to login as statproc, cd stats-proc/daily && ./audit.sql $PROJECT_ID

IF AUDIT.SQL ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROJECT, DO NOT PROCEED

6. If you're recovering from a statsrun that died, you'll need to handle some of the steps manually.
See stats-proc/daily/runday and runday2

7. Finally, if you're cleaning up from a bombed run, you'll need to remove the lockfile from ~statproc/log
