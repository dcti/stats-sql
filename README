# The stats-sql directory contains all the bootstrap and maintenance sql
# code used in creating/rebuilding/maintaining the stats database.
#
# Much of this code is pretty rough around the edges.  Some routines were
# coded to solve a specific circumstance.  None of the code in this 
# directory should be considered safe to run without thoroughly understanding
# its function.
#
# Please check each routine for internal documentation before running.
