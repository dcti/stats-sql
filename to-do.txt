$Id:

* Add DDL script to create defaults def0 and defspace

* Design structures for plans a, b, and c for stats v2:
  a) One set of tables (master, import, CACHE) for each contest.  Minor corrections to current design
  b) Single master and import for all contests, including a field to indicate contest.
  c) One master and import table for fixed-unit, fixed-total-effort projects (RC5, CSC, DES), another for variable length
contests (OGR)

* Benchmark plans a, b, c to decide which plan to implement.

* Develop stored procedure version of retire_to logic which is currently in a PHP script.

* Procedure-ize statproc mechanisms, change all objects to dbo-owned.  Eliminate the need to drop and recreate CACHE tables
every night.

* Change statproc so portions (imports, participant adds, team adds) can be performed hourly

* Clean up defaults created with automatic names and replace with shared, common value defaults

* Compile list of other stats which can be cheaply produced but with high appeal to participants
