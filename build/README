The schema script is expecting the pgsql account to exist in the database, so
if you use the -O option on createdb you will need to either create that account
or modify the schema file.

If you're not using an account called 'statproc' to do the statsproc stuff, you
will need to change the owner of the import_bcp table. The best way to do this is
via psql:

ALTER GROUP processing ADD USER otheruser;
ALTER TABLE import_bcp OWNER TO otheruser;

If you run build.sh more than once you'll get some user/group errors. It's normal.

If you have logs for old projects you should update the projects table and set their
status to 'O' for 'open'. IE:

UPDATE projects SET status='O' WHERE project_id=24;
