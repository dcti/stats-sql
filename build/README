The schema script is expecting the pgsql account to exist in the database, so
if you use the -O option on createdb you will need to either create that account
or modify the schema file.

If you're not using an account called 'statproc' to do the statsproc stuff, you
will need to change the owner of the import_bcp table. The best way to do this is
via psql:

ALTER GROUP processing ADD USER otheruser;
ALTER TABLE import_bcp OWNER TO otheruser;

If you run build.sh more than once you'll get some user/group errors. It's normal.

I've tried to provide a projects table that will probably make sense for personal
stats, but you should double-check project_type and status. Project_type needs to
match @projects in statsconf.pm, and projects with a status != 'O' will not be run.
