# This table holds miscellaneous figures for each day of the contest.
#
# In addition to creating the table, this script will attempt to 
# populate it with data from an existing RC5_64_master table.
#
# For safety's sake, this script does not include the appropriate
# "drop table" command.  If the table already exists, you will have
# to manually drop the table before this script will function.
